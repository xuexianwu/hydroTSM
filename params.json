In particular, this package is highly oriented to hydrological modelling tasks.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this package has been put in providing a collection of tools useful for the daily work of hydrologists (although an effort was made to optimize each function as much as possible, functionality has had priority over speed).\r\n\r\nBugs / comments / questions / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed, and in particular, datasets that can be included in this package for academic purposes.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
